Types of Tests Run on the Program
Several types of tests were run on the program, such as unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. Unit tests ensured that individual functions within the program produced the anticipated output. Integration tests verified how different functions interacted with one another. Acceptance tests guaranteed that the program met the assignment's requirements by testing its overall functionality.

Outcome of the Program
The program passed all unit, integration, and acceptance tests during testing. It simulated an online store that enabled users to add items to a cart, remove items, and update items. New features, such as the ability to search for items and view a detailed list of items in the cart, were added to the revised program.
